      "Idea about EcoMoney is made in 2021. With that idea we decide to enter the SIA (Social Impact Award) competition, which is organized in cooperation with the Mozaik Foundation. The competition took six months, which were divided into two stages. In first stage we worked on concept of idea. In the second stage we worked more on idea details, strategy, and research, where we ended up with the whole project plan, written in documents. We passed the first stage, we passed the second stage, and we have reached the narrow circle with only six ideas left. On the final day we are declared winners, with our idea, which has big potential. Since then we have had ups and downs with realization, but the app is currently in development. The main goal of the app is to give gifts to users. The idea is when users do something useful for ecology they will be awarded. On our app will be challenges, users who done challenge will be awarded with eco coins that are exchangeable for prizes in our store. Technologies that are used to build this app are React.js for frontend, Spring Boot for backend, and MySQL for database.",
